# Modified 3D Printed Peristaltic Pump

## Introduction
This repository contains the necessary files, including parts, codes, and documentation, to realize a modified version of a 3D printed peristaltic pump. The modifications aim to enhance reproducibility and accessibility while maintaining performance and affordability. The pump design is adapted from an original paper, with adjustments made to facilitate easier replication using readily available materials and components.

## Contents
1. **Parts**: The `Parts` folder contains files for the 3D printed and laser-cut parts required for constructing the peristaltic pump. It includes STL files for PLA and resin printing and SVG files for laser cutting acrylic sheets.

2. **Code**: Here you'll find the Arduino code used to control the stepper motor and drive the pump in the `Arduino code` folder

3. **Documentation**: This directory includes detailed documentation outlining the assembly instructions, operating procedures, maintenance guidelines, and troubleshooting tips for the peristaltic pump.
